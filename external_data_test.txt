I'll preface this by stating that I do NOT understand the mixed reviews. There is not one element of this that I would've done differently. This 2-hour-and-41-minute epic had me hooked from start to finish. No other Marvel property in my opinion, particularly in Phase 4, can match this level of quality, and that's in no small part due to Ryan Coogler, Angela Bassett, Letitia Wright, and the incredibly talented (not to mention gorgeous) newcomer Tenoch Huerta. The talent on display in *every single element* of this film is going to be tough to match, even from next month's Avatar: The Way of Water. Speaking of Avatar 2, they now have some SERIOUS competition in EVERY Oscar category next year, thanks to this film. I could honestly see this sweeping every category and making a strong play for Best Picture. The acting: Fantastic. Angela Bassett is magnificent. Letitia Wright is wonderful.  Tenoch Huerta brings a depth to his Namor that is rare in any film, much less a Marvel one. I believe he is perhaps an even better incarnation of the already-deep Killmonger from the first film. It's hard not to see the world from his perspective at least once. The technical craft: Spectacular. I haven't wanted to visit a new world so badly (the underwater world of Talokan) since the first Black Panther sent me to Wakanda and the first Avatar sent me to Pandora. It. Is. Breathtaking. The score: Unparalleled. Ludwig Goransson has outdone himself with this. It's even better than the first film. It's my favorite score for a movie in years. The writing and direction: Masterful. Ryan Coogler deserves recognition for elevating this DRAMATICALLY above anything else offered up in Marvel's mixed-bag Phase 4. Coogler manages to make an above-par Marvel epic that has meaningful things to say about loss, grief, sisterhood, motherhood, friendship, and moving on, while also ending on a POWERFUL and prescient note about how nations should treat each other in this post-modern world we all inhabit. What else is there to say? I loved every minute of it.
